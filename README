This is ConsoleSnake, the Snake game made for the Windows console!

My code was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. It has been tested on Windows XP and Windows 7 (64-bit). You may compile it yourself, download the source code and modify it to your liking, and generally do whatever. I don't really care too badly, as long as you don't claim it's yours. Because it's not. It's mine. You may not remove the copyright notices at the bottom of each file. If you repost this on another site, give me credit and link back here to the github. Thank you.
